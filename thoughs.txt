  With the last commit. Nothing works. I took out the trailing stop and I added the old open condition and close condition. Need to do a few things

    - Need to take out momentum
    - Need to add ADX
    - Need to work on iStochastic. Maybe research how it is used?

  This current version has a lot settings.


Need a little divine intervention.

Working with moving averages. I think the problem with my enter and exit of the market is not knowing the cross over of the moving average. 
I need to experiment with the value of a the moving average before the current bar and the current part.
At that point check to see if the past bar is in the opposite direction of the current. Once i determin this
I can figure out if it is a buy or if it a sell. 


Also another thought. The hour trend is trending in a particular direction. We can check for the moving average on the 1 minutes
and when that happens open a trade in the direction of the 1 hour. 

We should also monitor the moving average on the hour. If the moving average on the hour changes, close any trade on the open in the opposite direction.
